HMM- based POS Tagger using Viterbi Heuristic

HMMs and Viterbi for POS tagging -Viterbi Modification-Technique I (40%)120/120
Feedback: 
You were able to implement the problem's solution techniques correctly.
Both the approaches are correct. 

For other technique you can try once with tagging all the Unknown Words as Noun, Adjective intuitively or try to run Viterbi Algo by keeping Emission Probability as 0 for all the unknown works.
