Exploratory Analysis

Feedback: In this task you have to perform Exploratory Data Analysis to the given dataset. EDA is one of the crucial step in data science that allows us to achieve certain insights and statistical measure that is essential for the business continuity, stockholders and data scientists. It performs to define and refine our important features variable selection, that will be used in our model.

To be precise you have to inspect the dataframe and visualise the data using pairplots, correlation table and heatmaps.

Partial marks are given if all the above are not performed but the observation are made.
Data Cleaning - Null Value Imputation

Feedback: In this task, you have to take care of the null or the missing values. Here looking at the EDA performed and the data, you should impute the missing values with the median where it is appropriate. Please look in the solution for complete understanding.

Partial marks are given if the columns are missed and the values are not imputed correctl for all the columns.
